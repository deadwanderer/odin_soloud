# Odin Soloud bindings _\*VERY WIP\*_

A wrapper for [Soloud](https://solhsa.com/soloud/index.html).

Currently only built/tested on Windows.

Tests/examples are in the tests folder.

Copy the DLL from the `lib/windows/<debug|release>` folder into the same directory as your .exe before running.
